                a smooth return. Just ensure the item is unused, in its original
                packaging, and accompanied by proof of purchase. Depending on
                your preference, we offer the choice of a refund or store
                credit. Our goal is to make your shopping journey risk-free and
                enjoyable, so you can shop with confidence knowing that your
